# Water-Jug
A Java program to solve 3*5 Water Jug problem 

This program solves the 3*5 water jug problem where you have to get 4 litres of water in the 5 litre jug.
To change the capacity of the jugs, just change the input values or take user input for even better experience in the WaterJug.java file and You must also make changes in the Gui.java file to get the proper Graphical representation of the water jug solving process.
In general this program is destined to reach the goal of getting water 1 litre less than the capacity of larger jug into the larger jug.

Note : This Program works well only for odd capacity input.

Any queries/doubts reagrding the program ?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
